domain_info.pl is a standalone perl script that shouldn't require
any additional CPAN modules.

It takes as input a domain name (i.e. example.com) and returns a nicely
formatted report of public infromation about the domain: condensed/important
WHOIS information, along with DNS information (specifically, the 'A' records 
for the domain, the www subdomain, and whatever subdomain you optionally
specify).

Examples:
domain_info.pl example.com
domain_info.pl store.example.com

Both of these examples will show the condensed whois information for
'example.com', along with the following DNS records:

A record for example.com
A record for www.example.com
MX records for example.com

The store.example.com version will also show the 'A' record for
'store.example.com'.

It also performs a reverse-WHOIS on the returned IP addresses, which will
show you the listed owner of the IP address(es).

The WHOIS fields which are displayed:
* current registrar
* expiration date
* any 'status' fields
* any nameserver records

If the WHOIS information is returned in a way that confuses the script,
the full output of a 'whois' command is displayed instead of the condensed
version.

Full output looks like this:

$ ./domain_info.pl github.com

github.com

=== Notes ===
The WHOIS scraping seems to work very well via Mac's terminal, but not on Linux.  I'll try to find a more standardized way to scrape WHOIS for this information.
